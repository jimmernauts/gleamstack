Courgette, feta and red onion tart (pictured top)
Prep 20 min
Chill 30 min
Cook 1 hr 35 min
Serves 6

240g shortcrust pastry

For the filling
70ml olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
2 red onions, peeled and cut into thin wedges
25g unsalted butter
4 courgettes, washed, trimmed and cut into 1cm-thick discs
3 eggs
2 egg yolks
250ml double cream
Flaky sea salt and black pepper
1 tsp chilli jam (optional)
180g feta
1 handful finely chopped mint leaves

Roll out the pastry to 2mm thick, then lay it over a greased 30cm fluted tart tin, pressing it into the contours of the tin, and chill in the fridge for half an hour.

Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. Line the surface of the chilled pastry with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans or rice, and blind bake for 15 minutes. Remove the beans/rice and paper and bake for a further 10 minutes, then take out of the oven and set aside.

Put the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan on a low heat, add the garlic and red onions, and cook gently for 10-15 minutes, until the onions have softened. Add the butter and courgettes, and cook, stirring every now and then, for another 10 minutes, until cooked through and golden, without turning them to mush. Once cooked, take off the heat and leave to cool.

Whisk the eggs, egg yolks and cream in a bowl, then season and, if using, add the chilli jam (I happened to have some in the cupboard, so popped it into the mix). Crumble in the cheese, then stir in the cooled courgette mix and chopped mint. Check again for seasoning.

Pour the mixture into the tart case – make sure it’s nice and full – then bake for about 45 minutes, until the centre is just firm to the touch. Remove and leave to cool.

If you are taking the tart to a picnic, leave it in its tin and put that in a cardboard box, because it is quite delicate. To serve, gently press the tart out of the tin, slice and serve with salad and cold white wine.
