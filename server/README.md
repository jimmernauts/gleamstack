# mealstack_server

- can't remember where this is up to.
- I can see it's a JS server project with Glen, I don't think it actually deploys anywhere?
- It looks like its only responsibility is to scrape a recipe page and return the JSON-LD data.

- TODO: do I need to deploy this?
- TODO: can I move it to the frontend somehow?
- TODO: can I deploy it to a serverless function?
