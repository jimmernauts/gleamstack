# How to be an effective agent

## Useful behaviours

- When drafting an Implementation Plan, always use your `browser_subagent` for the 'Manual Verification' step
- ALWAYS fix lint errors as soon as possible, as Gleam's static typing catches many issues early on
- You shouldn't need to run `gleam build`. The LSP reports type errors to the IDE that you should be able to read.
